Hi, I am a Tokyo based design engineer / researcher born in Tokyo and raised in Texas.
My interests are at the intersection of technological affordance and design research.

I currently reside in [Yasuhi Kakehi's xlab](http://www.xlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/) studying interaction design when it was formally taught at SFC, and also part of [Daijiro Mizuno Lab](http://www.daijirom.com/) studying the intersection of computational design and design research.
