Hi, I'm Kye Shimizu, a transdisciplinary design engineer, currently based in Tokyo, Japan.

My interests are at the intersections of design research and interaction design in various fields such as fashion design, wearable technology, and also generative design. Giving focus to historical, existing, and speculative references, I aim to explore the boundaries existing in what relationship we have with technology.


I currently reside in [Yasuhi Kakehi's xlab](https://www.xlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/), an acclaimed researcher and media artist, studying interaction design. I am also part of the [Daijiro Mizuno Lab](https://www.daijirom.com/), studying the intersection of computational design and design research.
