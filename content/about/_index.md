Hi, I am a Tokyo based design engineer / researcher born in Tokyo and raised in Texas.
My interests are at the intersection of design research and technological affordance, and how we can create that using code.



I currently reside in [Yasuhi Kakehi's xlab](https://www.xlab.sfc.keio.ac.jp/), an acclaimed researcher and media artist, studying interaction design. I am also part of the [Daijiro Mizuno Lab](https://www.daijirom.com/), studying the intersection of computational design and design research.
