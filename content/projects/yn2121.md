Along with the [YUIMA NAKAZATO Paris Couture 18SS]({{ .Site.BaseURL }}/projects/yn18ss) Fashion show that was exhibited in Paris, I was asked to participate along with members of the Daijiro Mizuno Lab to help exhibit the show pieces at the 2121 Design Sight located in Roppongi, Tokyo. 

Not only other fashion designers, but also artists, engineers, and other creators from different backgrounds were invited to help share the vision that the company had, and also to speculate about the future of the fashion industry.

The mechanics of the "Mobile Factory" were not only displayed for the attendees to see the process of the design, but also were able to interact and create their own data.
