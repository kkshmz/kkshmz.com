Created the Xperia XZ camera booth for IFA 2016 as part of Abacus Inc, a digital conglomerate headed by Saito Tatsuya. The interactive booth showcased some of the possibilities of the new flagship from Sony.

3 booths were setup to showcase the features of the camera that came with the flagship smartphone. 

The first is the shutter speed of the smartphone, which was displayed by the use of a toy train running along a track. The speed of the train shows that the phone is capable of fast motion photography.

The shutterspeed is not only good for close range objects, but also for varying distances, in which the focus of the camera is assisted by the laser autofocusing technology of the Xperia.

Lastly, the new Xperia XZ comes with automated infared adjustment when taking pictures, so that the colors of the picture come out the way that you see them.
