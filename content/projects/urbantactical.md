This project was for a Digital Fabrication Class held in the summer of 2017, to fabricate a product that would help people be able to participate in urban tacticalism in Yokohama.
We designed a bench and table system using CNC and CAD software that would allow people to create benches and tables from already avaliable structure in Yokohama.

The architecture of the bench is created using a joint mechanism that is able to designed to create universal designs that enable

### Research of the field
The initial idea came from research and observation in the field.
People often used this street for a means of rest during their workday, a brief moment to smoke, or just chat while having coffee by a nearby stand.

The idea of creating benches not only came from the everyday observations, but also through interacting with the foodtruck owners using temporary spaces to sell to local workers, that they were unlicensed.

### Prototyping research
Because the bench that is set beside the street was unscannable, we measured the bench and created a 3d model based off of the measurements.

### Result
During open festivals, the bench was used by locals as a means for their luggage and convinience.
