Junction Asia was created in a joint program with the [Junction](https://hackjunction.com/) in Helsinki, that would partake a week before [Slush](http://www.slush.org/) happened.

Junction Asia was created with the international audience as well as designers in mind, who would be hesitant to join other hackathons that heavily focused on the use of APIs.

Through the production of the event, I participated in collaborating with companies through sponsorships, and the production of the venue.

The hackathon comprised of 3 tracks, each track being sponsored by 1 or more companies, who would sponsor their APIs and prizes. 

Some of the companies included Softbank Japan, Japan Airlines, and Lenovo Japan.

The final projects that were chosen among the tracks by peer voting, would pitch infront of all the attendees and esteemed judges such as 500 Startups Japan General Partner Yohei Sawayama.

This project was made in joint with Slush Asia 2016, comprised fully of student volunteers from start to finish. I would like to acknowledge them for the effort and dedication put into this project, which literally started in a conversation in a cafe.
