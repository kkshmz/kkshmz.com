As part of the [YUIMA NAKAZATO Paris Couture 18SS]({{ .Site.BaseURL }}/projects/yn18ss), technical research was displayed during the show to display the process of the design and the concept behind the show pieces.

"Mobile Factory" is a key concept behind the show pieces, speculating on the future of fashion where fashion itself is not limited to the studio of the fashion designer or the factory.
