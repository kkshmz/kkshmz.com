This is a project that was created in collaboration with [Sonilab](http://sonilab.org/contents/about) and [SJQ++](http://sjq.jp/sjqpp/).
[Sonilab](http://sonilab.org/contents/about) is a creative group of producers that aim to give a different perspective to how we interact with music. Being a member of [Sonilab](http://sonilab.org/contents/about), I was in charge of creating the scraping mechanism for the sounds, rearrange them into genres, and also the scraping mechanism for the images for the interactive tablet in the museum.

This porject with [SJQ++](http://sjq.jp/sjqpp/) was created for the Chiba City Museum of Art and videographer [Hayashi Yuki](http://kanyukuyuki.tumblr.com), creating a live interactive installation that is interactive both offline and online.

The installation online is an interactive application that is connected with a twitter bot, with the user mentioning the bots name while uploading a photo.

The photo is then turned into an agent organism that is represented by lines and dots, to live in the new enviornment.

When the agent is born into the new enviornment, the agent releases sound that is scraped from the web, representing its origin from the vast web.
