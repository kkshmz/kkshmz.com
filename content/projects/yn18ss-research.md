Being invited by Daijiro Mizuno Lab, I explored the technical possibilities and researched for initial prototypes and creation for the Yuima Nakazato 2018 Spring Summer Paris Couture Fashion Week.

Inital concepts about the collection were traded among our team and the fashion label, creating initial sketches and prototypes that would give some vision on what kind of structure and detail could be made. 

Inspirations came from attractors and gravity fields, which held beauty in being simple mathmatical equations that harvested detailed graphical outputs

Prototypes were created using laser fabrication machines, which allowed for precise cutting and also enabling programmable interactions

White leather material was used along side recycled material from parachutes to car bags, with the theme of protecting the user.
From history, many of the clothing that were used for space exploration

Each piece of the fashion show was custom generated through software that would cut the sections to fit the user.

Not only does this allow for comfortability of the clothing itself, but also allows for spot refabrication when parts of the clothing deteriorate with time or the ability to modularly change the form of the clothing when needed.
