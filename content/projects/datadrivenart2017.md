This is a class project done for the Class "Data Driven Art" by Daito Manabe and Kakehi Yasuaki exploring the inbetweens of brain interface. 
Other adjucent professors include Shinya Fujii and Masashi Nakatani of the Faculty of Enviornmental Information at Keio University.

The class itself was a intensive workshop based class that was done throughout the span of a week, with introductions into the current state of OpenBCI and other brain interface mechanisms.

We aimed to try and experiment if the endorphins and other chemicals released from hugging a person is different among other objects.
This "huggability" of objects was then transfered through the OpenBCI headset, which was then analyzed over machine learning.

As the project itself only let a week for the prototyping process with limited headsets, we were only able to experiment with a limited number of datasets. 

The system to realize this project was a coorelation between the OpenBCI sensing, which would then be analyzed through oF and evaluated some of the outlying numbers through max and sent to Wekinator to see the final "huggability".
