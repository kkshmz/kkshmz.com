Original work by [Rhizomatiks](https://rhizomatiks.com/) and Ryuichi Sakamoto, I was asked to partake in the update and installation of [Sensing Streams](https://research.rhizomatiks.com/s/works/sensing_streams/en/) for ACT Festival Korea 2018 held in Gwanju, South Korea.

With the theme of this year's festival being, [Otherly Space Knowledge](https://www.acc.go.kr/board/schedule/exhibition/1914) , [Rhizomatiks](https://rhizomatiks.com/) was asked to exhibit [Sensing Streams](https://research.rhizomatiks.com/s/works/sensing_streams/en/) for its outlook on radio waves around us that we cannot see, but use everyday.

The installation is reactive to the radio frequencies that are sensed realtime throughout the room , creating a realization of the waves around us.

Below are some of the visualizations created from the Gwanju radio waves.
