Slush Asia is a project that was started in 2015 with the help of Taizo Son and members of Mistletoe, being the first international Slush that was held outside of Finland.
Slush is originally an event that brings together entrepreneurs, investors, startups and students together to discuss and collaborate on working towards the future.

Slush Asia 2015 was held in an outside venue in Odaiba, with the use of "White Rock" dome shaped tents that gave a certain appeal of "exploration" that the startups themselves are doing in terms of business

Slush Asia was the first of its kind, but brought in a multitude of speakers from different backgrounds to inspire the next generation of entreprenuers and give mentoring to those currently.

I was not only responsible for some of the overview of the event itself, but also for some of the accomodatino of hte speakers such as Tom Kelley from IDEO and Dave McClure from 500 Startups.

Not only was the event a resounding success among the visitors, but also was a first step into a entreprenurial movement in Japan.
