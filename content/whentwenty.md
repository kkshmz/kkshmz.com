One thing that I do think now is that I want to make this year, the best year of my life.

It's the last year that I can apply for something like the Founders Fund Foundation for young entrepreneurs, and its something that I have been putting myself to do something for years.

Thinking about my place in time right now, the time before me has always had some sort of deadline.
Back in my childhood, I would always joke around that I had a set date to my death, which was something that was more dramatic than anything, but was something for myself that I wanted to have because I knew that goalposts along the way such as finishing grade school or getting into college was something that was temporary and that after this was done, that the goalposts would be something that I would have to create along the way.
20 was somewhat of a big goalpost for me, as the most successful were 20 something when they started.
Hell, look at Stripe right now.
Just something really awsome that I look at those founders, with not only the technologoical solutionism to the problem, but also this world ideaology.

Right now I know the world that money is not something I should be pursuing, but experience, but I need to manage my own burn rate.
Knowing your own burn rate is something that is necessary

It is not something to be worreid or even to care about the age of other people, but  when I came back to my mother country, being in the ridiculed place that was Japanese highschool, age and grade had always be came a ceratin something for me as it is in all people in the country.

Not only was it a factor in the sense that I looked up or looked down with the same criticism I had for people much older than me, but I was able to comfort myself with the agev that I was or the grade that I had accomplished in.

I think I have some sort of stoicism for the things that happen at my age but I lso have something profound to those above me, and my elders.

The fact that someone my age and someone 20 years before me can reminneice on the same memories or the same expereiences that we had is extrodinarily magical, but also at the same time , frightening.

Some people say that Life is short.
But really, is Life short?
If we were to know the period of time that we would be alive, or the percentage that you would be alive for and add x amount of years to that, would that perception change?

There is always a cliche going on with the amount of life that you are actually able to do something.
If you live to be 100, 15 years in childhood, 15 years in old age, and 33 years are taken up with sleep, that leaves you just 37 years to create something meaningful.

If this was perhaps 200, would this perception change?
Would the layout of the numbers change or how would we react to the amount of life that we have aorund us?
How would institutions change?




Lets say, your
If 33 years are taken up with sleep, 10 years in childhood, and 20 years lost in old age, that leaves just 37 years to create something meaningful.
It was a number that in my mind I was a bit put off with, a bit scared.
I have always been critical of people who judge people by age, but as I begin to understand, age is now becoming a framework to judge upon the standard.
It was the age that Steve dropped off at, it was the age that .
Age has never bothered me, but knowing that there were people who accomplished more with alot less is not only something to strive for rather than be jealous of the situation, bu appreciative that we have came this far.



I fear about my future. Alot.
Sometimes I manage those fears, sometimes I don't.

In many ways, it's not just about worrying about the future as it is about worrying about the past.
It's constantly questioning your past, fretful that some burnt bridge or wrong turn has quietly and imperceptibly wrecked everything.
It's not being able look at the road in the rearview, it's not being able to connect the dots looking backwards, however cliche that may seem.

It's not only something about what has been done, but what also had never happened.
During grade school, I was undefeated in chess, only never facing the formidable opponent who was as equally skilled as me.
Afraid of defeat, I never faced him.
I wonder if I would have won against Pavan.

But as I begin to understand this, I have learned to disassociate with my past self or to love as equally.
I'm no longer that person, or at least I don't have to be.


One of the largest manifestations of my fear of the future that I’ve noticed is that I constantly procrastinate on my responsibilities. Sometimes small menial tasks that I know need to be done such as sending a text or responding to an e-mail give me anxiety.
Long term goals such as turning my health around are always projects that I want to start tomorrow and not now.
Perhaps in a weird way to cope with that resulting feeling of emptiness that comes from knowing I’m sabotaging/restricting myself, I daydream. Alot.





Some people get through this by saying that life s

During my childhood, I would often think about suicide, or cutting my life short, just a few years or so. No one I knew actually did, but some have thought about it, and even less have actually tried.

I don’t know where I’m going to be in the next year, or how I’m going to get there. If there are major changes in my life, I’m sure they will be both instantaneous and incremental.
What I do know is that the change I have most power over, are the incremental ones.
It seems to make sense to start with those.

I know I will still be afraid, I know I’ll have plenty of reasons to be afraid. I’ll also have plenty of reasons to daydream again as well. But just as I need to change things in my present to confront those fantasies, I need to also change things in my present to confront those fears.

It’s hard knowing exactly what I need to do, but in my experience, most of it falls under continuing learning to love myself, to take better care of my body and to improve.

Just to "be".

I think i'll start with that.
