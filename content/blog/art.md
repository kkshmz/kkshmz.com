Making something good.
Art in many ways is to create or enlighten something for an audience, this could be to enlighten people to how much of their privacy is being used by companies or it could be to create a sense of thoughtfulness or remembereance by creating a unique melody through the ripples of an earthquake.

I used to grow up thinking that making something good was something that was subjective, and that to make something was to cater to an audience with that specific taste. While that is not fully incorrect, it implies that good taste is something that is subjective.


Context for Products
What has also happened is the intersection with art for many areas has expanded, so much so that the art itself now holds to need an explanation. Because of this, some people have become much more better at talking about the aspects behind the art, "eg. This piece represents the cross section of a post modern sexualist society in the urban context". This argument over the context of some work versus the value of the work itself is created through the mismatch of what the work portrays and what the explanation itself shows. Of course, this can be argued that it isn't intended for that audience, there for good art must imply the auience thtat they are talking about. 

Mismatch such as this isn't an anomaly that only exists in art, but is the most predominant as there is social pressure to "get" some artwork because it is famous or for its brand. Some startups in SF for example, one startup that is being created by 2 ex-Google engineers are making a product that make mom and pop stores obsolete by making a smart fridge. Seems harmless right? Or how about the startup that has a obsurd juicer that safely executes the juicing process for the juice that they provide. These can seem harmless, but really the distress can be found in the creation of these products. Though they may express the fullest of intents, it doesnt seem to show in the product.
